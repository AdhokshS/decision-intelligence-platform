# Decision Intelligence Platform (Posture-Sensitive Prioritization Engine)

A deterministic decision intelligence platform that models how organizations prioritize initiatives under different strategic conditions while explicitly surfacing trade-offs, operational constraints, and decision confidence.

This system combines structured analytics, predictive modeling, optimization, and AI-assisted interpretation — while keeping decision logic fully auditable and human-controlled.

## 🔍 What This Tool Does

This platform transforms multi-factor signals into structured prioritization.

It does **not automate decisions**.  
Instead, it:

- Surfaces how rankings change under different strategic postures  
- Highlights trade-offs across competing priorities  
- Identifies operational bottlenecks and dependencies  
- Quantifies decision confidence  
- Provides structured executive-level interpretation  

---

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

- Strategy-based prioritization (Growth / Risk / Balanced)
- Strategy sensitivity detection (Posture Delta)
- Predictive risk scoring (logistic regression)
- Resource allocation optimization under constraints
- Operational bottleneck identification
- Dependency graph modeling (critical path visibility)
- Deterministic executive decision brief
- AI-based strategic interpretation (Groq Llama 3.1)

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Traditional dashboards show metrics.

This platform shows:

- How priorities shift under different strategies  
- Where decisions are sensitive and require judgment  
- Where execution bottlenecks may occur  
- How constraints affect optimal decisions  
- How to interpret results in an executive-friendly format  

It bridges the gap between **data visibility and decision-making**.

## 🔒 Design Principle

The system separates deterministic decision modeling from AI interpretation.

- All prioritization logic is **deterministic and auditable**
- AI does **not influence or override decisions**
- AI is used only for **structured explanation**

This ensures strong governance and makes the system suitable for **high-stakes environments such as healthcare and operations**.
